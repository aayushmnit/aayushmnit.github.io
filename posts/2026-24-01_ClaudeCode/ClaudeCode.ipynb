    "If you've been following AI tooling trends, you've noticed something interesting: AI companies are going direct-to-developer. Cursor showed us what's possible when you embed AI deeply into a code editor. But now Claude (Anthropic) and other foundation model providers are shipping their own coding agents. This isn't just competition. It's a signal that the \"AI wrapper\" layer is collapsing, and the companies building the models want to own the developer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an ML Engineer, I spend my days building systems that learn from data. But I'm also a practitioner who uses AI tools daily. When Claude Code launched, I wanted to understand it deeply, not just use it casually. What makes it different from Cursor or Copilot? What new patterns does it enable? And most importantly: how do I get the most out of it for real engineering work?\n",

    "If you've done any prompt engineering, context engineering is the next step. The idea is simple: prompts are static, but context is dynamic. Your agent needs information from many sources (your input, previous interactions, tool outputs, external data) and assembling the right context at the right time is what separates agents that work from agents that fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course frames context engineering failures around three failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context poisoning**: A hallucination enters the context and corrupts every response that follows. Once bad information gets in, it spreads.\n",
    "- **Context confusion**: Irrelevant context pulls the model's attention in the wrong direction. You asked about database design but your frontend docs are drowning out the signal.\n",
    "- **Context clash**: Contradictory information in the same context. The model gets pulled between conflicting instructions or facts.\n",

    "3. **Context compression**: `/clear` wipes everything, `/compact` summarizes to essentials\n",
    "4. **Context isolation**: Subagents run in their own context windows, preventing main conversation bloat\n",

    "The course also covers the \"Goldilocks zone\" for system prompts. Too specific and you're treating the LLM like a state machine with hard-coded if/else logic. Too vague and you're saying \"do the right thing\" without defining what \"right\" means. Good prompts establish clear identity, empower rather than constrain, and teach principles instead of enumerated rules."

    "1. **Context engineering is prompt engineering's evolution.** Static prompts don't cut it for agents. You need dynamic context assembly from multiple sources, and Claude Code's three-tier memory hierarchy (user, project, dynamic imports) gives you explicit control over what the model knows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The extension system follows a clear hierarchy.** MCP connects external tools (always loaded, costs tokens). Skills load on-demand based on relevance (more efficient). Hooks enforce hard rules that override soft guidance. Plugins bundle everything for team distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subagents solve the context bloat problem.** Heavy tasks run in isolated context windows, returning condensed results. Your main conversation stays lean. Combine with git worktrees for parallel workflows that would take longer sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security remains your job.** Agents handle rule-based vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) well but miss authorization, business logic, and SSRF consistently. Treat AI-generated code like junior developer code: review everything, especially access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Start simple, extend as needed.** Run `/init`, edit your CLAUDE.md, learn `/compact` and `/rewind`. Add one MCP server, one hook, one skill. Plugins and parallel agents come later when you've outgrown the basics."
