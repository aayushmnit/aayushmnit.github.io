    "I'll be honest: I used to dread reading research papers. The dense math, the notation-heavy proofs, the assumption that you already know three other papers to understand this one. As an ML engineer, I knew these papers held insights I could apply at work, but actually extracting that value felt like a slog.\n",
    "\n",
    "My learning style doesn't mesh well with traditional academic writing. I learn best through small examples and code I can run and tinker with. Show me a 3x3 matrix example before the general n×n case. Let me see the algorithm work on toy data before throwing theorems at me.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years, this created a barrier. Research papers felt like they were written for PhDs, not practitioners. You either had the advanced math background to parse them, or you waited months for someone to write a blog post explaining it in plain English.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's changed. With AI assistants (both local and cloud-based LLMs), I can now have a conversation with a paper. I can ask \"what does this symbol mean?\" or \"show me this concept with a simple Python example\" and get an answer calibrated to my current understanding. The paper adapts to me, not the other way around.\n",

    "2. **\"Intuition before math\" matches how practitioners learn.** Most of us grasp concepts faster through examples and analogies than through theorem statements. If your learning style differs, swap in your own preferences here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"Tiny example first\" counteracts the LLM's default behavior.** Without this, models tend toward abstract, general explanations. Forcing concrete examples (a 3x3 matrix, a toy dataset) makes concepts stick.\n",
    "\n",

    "Reading technical papers used to be a solitary grind. You either had the background to parse the notation, or you didn't. AI changes this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what I want you to walk away with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The barrier to technical content has dropped.** The same workflow that worked for this paper works for textbooks, API documentation, dense blog posts, or any content where you need concepts explained at your level. The AI adapts to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You control the pace and depth.** Unlike courses or tutorials that assume a fixed audience, this approach lets you skip what you know and linger on what confuses you. Your learning path, not someone else's curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Local LLMs make this nearly free.** Ollama plus a capable open model means you can read papers all day without API costs. You can try reading books, YT transcripts, brainstorming using same method. One tool, many uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The system prompt is the lever.** Generic prompts give generic results. The tutor prompt we built forces the AI into a teaching mode that actually helps. Steal it, tweak it, make it yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Start with a paper you actually care about.** Don't practice on something boring. Pick a paper relevant to your work or a concept you've always wanted to understand. Motivation carries you through the setup friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools exist. The cost is minimal. The only question is which paper you'll read first.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you found this blog useful. If you have questions or want to share your own Claude Code patterns, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushmnit/)."
