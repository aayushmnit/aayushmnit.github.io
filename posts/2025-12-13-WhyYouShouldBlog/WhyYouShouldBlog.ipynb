    "1. **Curate and comment**: Make a list of links to blog posts, articles, or papers you like. Write brief summaries and highlight what you found useful. This is low-pressure and helpful to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summarize what you learned**: Attended a conference? Taking a class? Write up your notes and takeaways.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Turn emails into posts**: Any technical explanation you've written more than once in email or Slack should become a blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Write for yourself from a year ago**: You're best positioned to help people one step behind you. Your background, your style, and your knowledge level will give a different perspective than existing tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Answer: what would have helped me six months ago?**: Think about problems you struggled with and write the guide you wish existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Don't be a perfectionist**: Post your writing sooner rather than later. Waiting just builds pressure and you end up writing less. You can always update posts later."
