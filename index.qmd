:::{#about-me}
I am an experienced Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on designing and implementing machine learning-driven solutions. Passionate about cutting-edge data technologies, my expertise spans big data platforms, deep learning, optimization techniques, and business analytics.  

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer on the Video Recommendations team at Meta, where I specialize in improving exploration strategies for the interest-oriented recommendations in Facebook Reels. Previously, at Microsoft, I developed data-driven products to deliver intelligent recommendations, empowering Microsoft Partners, M365 administrators, and end-users to optimize M365 service usage.  

My diverse experience includes working across various industries such as agricultural technology, pharmaceuticals, retail, e-commerce, and ride-sharing, contributing innovative solutions to complex challenges.
