# aayushmnit.github.io
Code for my website.

## For cloners - 
- Feel free to use this code or I have created a [template website code](https://github.com/aayushmnit/quarto_example) which resemble my website without any of my content, for your own website 

- More importantly, remove the google tag from _quarto.yml file, before starting editing this repo for your own website. I want to keep the website code public to encourage other devs to build their own website.
