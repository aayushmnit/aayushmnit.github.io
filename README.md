Code for my website.

## For cloners - 
- Feel free to use this for your own website and please consider dropping a star on the repo if you find it useful. 

- More importantly, remove the google tag from _quarto.yml file, before starting editing this repo for your own website. I want to keep the website code public to encourage other devs to build their own website.
