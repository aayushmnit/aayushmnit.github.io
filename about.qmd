I'm an experienced Machine learning engineer with specialized skills in machine learning-based solutions. I thrive on staying at the forefront of cutting-edge data technologies, including big data platforms, deep learning, optimization methods, and business analytics. Currently, I am part of the MLE team at Meta, where I focus on enhancing exploration strategies for the interest-oriented recommendation system in FB Reels. My previous work at Microsoft involved building data-driven products to enable smart recommendations for Microsoft Partners, M365 administrators, and end-users to optimize the usage of M365 services. I also have experience across various verticals, including agricultural technology, pharmaceuticals, retail, e-commerce, and the ride-sharing business model.
